# Automatically Login after Registration!

If I submitted this form right now, it would register me, but it would *not*
actually log me in... which is lame. Let's fix that.

This is *always* pretty easy, but it's *especially* easy because we're using
Guard authentication. Inside of `UserController`, instead of redirecting to the
home page: do this: `return $this->get()` to find a service called
`security.authentication.guard_handler`. It has a method on it called
`authenticUserAndHandleSuccess`. I'll clear the arguments and use multiple lines.

The first argument is the `$user` and the second is `$request`. The third argument is
the authenticator whose success behavior we want to mimic. Open up `service.yml`
and copy the service name for our authenticator. In the controller, use
`$this->get()` and paste the service id. Finally, the last argument is something
called a "provider key". You'll see that occasionally - it's a fancy term for the
name of your firewall. This name is almost *never* important, but it actually is
in this case. We'll say `main` and we're done!

## The Bonus Superpower

Now, this will log us in, but it *also* has a bonus super-power. Right now, we're
anonymous. So let's try to go to `/admin/genus`. Of course, it bounces us to the
login page. That's fine - click to register. Use `weaverryan+20@gmail.com`,
add a password and hit enter.

Check this out. Well, ignore the access denied screen.

First, it *did* log us in. And *second*, it redirected us back to the URL we were
trying to visit before we were sent to the login page. This is *really* great because
it means that if your user tries to access a secure page - like your checkout form -
they'll end up *back* on the checkout form after registration. Then they can
keep buying your cool stuff.

Of course, we see the access denied page because this user only has `ROLE_USER` and
the section requires `ROLE_MANAGE_GENUS`.

## Signing Off

Ok guys, that's it. Yes, you *can* get more complicated with security, especially
authentication. And if you need to check permissions that are *object* specific - like
I can edit only genuses that I created - then check out Symfony's awesome voter system.
Hey, we have a course on it!

But for the most part, you guys have the tools to do really incredible things. So
go out there, build something awesome and tell me about it.

Seeya next time!
